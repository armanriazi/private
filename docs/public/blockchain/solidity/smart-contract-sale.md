### Sale Contract

*  Who Wants to build Smartcontracts and DApps. basic knowledge on Ethereum Eco-System and Solidity Language is necessary to understand These Concepts.

*  I’m writing this step-by-step guide and I wish it is the best way to explain what Smart Contracts are. So let's get started.

 * E-commerce involves buying and selling of goods or services. So mainly it has buyers and sellers.

 * The following example is made of ethereum blockchain using a point-to-point product trading system. Each user buys a product via their MetaMask, which leads to the deduction of the amount of ethereum in the buyer's wallet and at the same time is credited to the seller's account according to the smart contract deployed.

* This sample does not follow the internal network in the previous sample It has got an ethereum test network called Kovan.
