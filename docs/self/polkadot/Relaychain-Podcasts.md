### Relay Chain PodCast 1(Dr.gavin wood)

[[Substrate]]
> Substrate have a strong engineering core

[[Policy&Security]]
**Dr{**
> Nation state vs Decentralized(dao,dac,protocol).  

> The virtue of technology is essential when we have trusted platforms. 
Facebook does not ==guarantee the privacy== of users. 
It's difficult to ==trust== governments and companies.
It is almost impossible to agree on any kind of global ==firewall== .
Potential Malicious actor or attack.

**}**

[[SmartContract]]

**Dr{**
> Unexpected State transition because of some bug, in a contract.

>Eth 2: The kind of smart contract model, although it does allow for that but to be used, but also for more fixed function pipeline, fixed function, transaction processing to be done. That can give much greater performance gains.

**}**

[[Governance]]

**Dr{**

> That's the point of governance. It's basically to work out this really soft notion of how many people expected it to do, X versus how many people expected it due to Y and the strength of those expectations.

> ==Lock-voting== system So they are refreshed in a sort of ==round-robin== files fashion so that none of them.
**}**

[[Security]]

**Dr{**
> Principle versus Pragmatism is needed for the detection of balance lies.

**}**

[[Words]]
**Dr{**
> calibration errors or drift

**}**

[[Skill]]

**Dr{**
> What do you think are the most important skills to have? And, what areas are lacking in the industry? 

> Deep thought is a really important skill. I'm not sure if it's a skill or talent. The ability to consume and internalize a problem and understand it. 

**}**

[[Economic]]
**Dr{**
> The rules that you can introduce would allow the emergent effects to become what it is that you want. That's an incredibly difficult thing to learn, but it's something that is very important in the world of sort of, you know, this trust-free digital crypto-economic world. 

**}**

[[Problem]]
**Dr{**
> I think understanding better, which problems are better solved in a decentralized fashion and which problems are perfectly fine

**}**

[[Transaction]]

**Dr{**

> High Transaction Outputs = Parallel Computing Blocks 

**}**

[[Summery-PolkadotEcosystem]]

**Dr{**

> Domain-Specific Chain(it is not scratch)

> Chain candidate is launching a Genesis block. It is Launch of a new chain but the chain that has been launched is a proof of authority chain. It's a staging area for us to move further and what it does is it allows us to start the chain without having to have a sort of A set of validators already assembled and without us having to trust in our potentially unfilled governance structure.

> Although there's a Genesis block for it. It's not necessarily the Genesis block for the final polkadot chain.

> Initial chain restricted runtime will have its limitations be lifted through a series of governance decisions.

> During the first phase polka dot will operate as a purely proof of authority chain, to proof of authority. 

> Simply means that we have a number of authorities on behalf of the web three Foundation, fix the validator nodes and these validator nodes that will never change. They will always be operated by the 13 foundation and they will be the ones producing you. 

> The first is the pseudo module so this will allow the 13 Foundation to upgrade the chain as a desires. The second piece is a pieces of functionality that can be used by the polka dot Community. The first is allowing claims, so that dot tokens or at least thought token, sort of indicators can be claimed. 

> The second piece(proof of stake)of functionality allows those who hold dot token allocations to Signal their intent? Attention to stay can become validators or nominators.

> 3 phase is where the pseudo key is enabled. Various pieces of governance to to function the governance. Operators have polka dot is fairly sophisticated. Now, it's evolved alongside kusama and broadly speaking, there are sort of four modules. 

> > 3.1 One is the referendums module, allowing a A coin, weighted voting system.holders are able to basically alter the fate of the polka dot Network. 
> > 3.2 council module, allowing adult token holders to elect a number of members. Polkadot Council doesn't actually are very much hard power but it is able to The legislative agenda and potentially remove dangerous, upgrade. 
> > 3.3 Third element is the technical committee. This is a non voted body and it's selected simply by those teams that have properly implemented. Polkadot, it doesn't have any real substantial power but it is able to fast-track certain upgrades, certain changes to the chain. That the, that it believes are important. Usually, these will be bug fixes. Then the 3.4 fourth piece of the Evidence operators is the treasury. treasury allows the council as well as various as well as the assembled dot token Alders, to place funds, that have been have been amassed through the staking system through the block reward system and put them to use on things. Typically external to polka dot. 

> Finalize phase: Final runtime upgrade initiated by the web three foundation will remove the pseudo module and in doing so remove its omnipotent position as being able to cancel the chain as being able to create a new chain candidate at that point. Polkadot is a live decentralized and permissionless Network The final stages of polka dots. Roll out about them. You only need to look as far as kusama now once the council...

> Final runtime upgrade initiated by the web 3 foundation will remove the pseudo module and in doing so remove its omnipotent position as being able to Remove its omnipotent position as being able to cancel the chain as being able to create a new chain candidate at that point polka. Dot is a live decentralized and permissionless Network The final stages of polka dots, rollout will be delivering the, these extra pieces of functionality. One of those extra pieces of functionality will be the balance transfers. This will allow dot tokens to be transferable and not just an indicator, and this will likely happen very soon after the pseudo module is released. But of course, we don't know what point because it will be in the hands of the dot token holders. 

> Two more posts to do upgrades will then necessarily include the rollout of the first pair of chains and eventually para chain, and para, thread, purchasing, or leasing modules. And finally, the XE m p, cross para chain, message passing system. 

>  Kusuma have 1000 tips without any ZK snarks or lighting networks.

> we have seamless upgrades that are controlled by the underlying logic of the consensus

> Web 3 allows people come together and coordinate more

> Dot is a amorphous protocol.
