Additionally, PostgreSQL allows for the creation of role groups, where a single GRANT command can grant privileges to multiple users at once. This can be useful for simplifying the management of user access in larger databases with many users. 

```sql
GRANT INSERT ON Product TO developer WITH GRANT OPTION; --clause to allow the user to grant privileges to other users. 
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_privileges WHERE grantee='developer';
```
