<blockquote>
<p>I've worked in software engineering for my entire 12-years career, and <strong>my commitment to critical thinking</strong> and <strong>attention to deep problems</strong> have gotten me to where I am today.
I <strong>graduated</strong> with a master's degree in information technology from the University of Najafabad, in 2021. Which is one of the top 200 the universities in the world.</p>
<p>I always have a strong <strong>willingness</strong> to learn.</p>
<p><strong>I've got</strong> a lot of experience and knowledge in different sectors. But I've got my decision for more concentrate on polka ecosystem and rust. <strong>Although my past knowledge</strong> helped me for understanding Blockchain and the capability of learning new technologies. <strong>I'd really like the opportunity</strong> to use all these experiences in the services of a company for getting more profit.</p>
<p><strong>I took my own time</strong> to study the program and mastered it quickly. </p>
<p><strong>During</strong> my work on DevOps and web development until 2020 as you can see my works on the archive section of my personal website <strong>I attend</strong> to the cryptocurrency and Blockchain development.</p>
<p>I think my <strong>strongest trait</strong> is my attention to detail. this trait has helped me tremendously in this field of work. <strong>That resulted in taking too much time</strong> on a particular task and it shows down my work, after that, I found my work and efficacy increased dramatically. As a developer, it is important to understand all areas of the project. </p>
<p><strong>I enjoy</strong> being around different types of people and I always like to challenge myself to improve at everything I do. </p>
<p>I take charge and head work up when from the front <strong>matters</strong>.</p>
<p>I am quite <strong>easy going</strong> I suppose I work well with anyone and my attitude is "anything goes".</p>
<p>Finally, I will be more <strong>diligent</strong> if I take a good suggestion.</p>
