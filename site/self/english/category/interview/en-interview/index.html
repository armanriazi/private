I have two quick questions though.What does success look like?Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger company?</li>
</ol>
<p>I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won't be bringing too many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the company.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you manage your time?</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, so I think so. I'm a very organized person. I have a huge filing system and I always know where everything is. I schedule my day carefully and try to make an appointment so I can keep.</p>
<h1 id="organized">Organized<a class="headerlink" href="#organized" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I naturally organize things. Iike time, assignment,  and work.
I like to organize my work by priority and deadlines.
I consider myself organized .</p>
<h1 id="mange-time">Mange time<a class="headerlink" href="#mange-time" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I'm good at managing my time.  I prioritize my tasks and this allows me to stay ahead of schedule. So I can achieve more than I set out to do
The area I need to improve is probably browser bookmarks. If I know I'm having guest or customer, then I would definitely make things more tidy.</p>
<h1 id="delay-deliver">delay deliver<a class="headerlink" href="#delay-deliver" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I remember one time in the middle of the project...
I estimated that it will take 3 additional days....
I knew the additional work was too large to finish on time.
I should have more firm telling them that we will need a few more days</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the biggest difficulty you have ever faced at work last year?</li>
</ol>
<p>We had a problem with the new software. We've installed it wasn't working properly and we were losing a lot of money because of it. It was down to me to fix it. So I worked round the clock. I finally found a way around it, but it was really hard work and the pressure was unbelievable.</p>
<ol>
<li>can you remember a time when you helped resolve the conflicts among your colleagues or classmates a couple of months ago?</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a problem in my department a new system meant that you had to sign in and out all the time many people didn't like this because there was only one place you could sign in which was a long way from where most people work. I suggested we put signing in stations at several locations and that seemed to solve the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you ever had to work on a topic? You knew nothing about?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes I'm giving something that I don't know much about so I do some investigation and ask her out get up to speed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you comfortable making decisions and taking the lead ?</li>
</ol>
<p>we're going to lose I think some decisions are better left two people more senior. For example, I don't like fighting anyone.</p>
<ol>
<li>how you dealing with problems?</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm good at dealing with problems.
Basically I want to find a potential  problem and put measures in place to correct  it before it happens.
It's very important to anticipate a problem and fix it before  it becomes a real problem . It is important  to view problems form different  perspectives.</p>
<h1 id="good-decisions-for-a-solution-of-problem">good decisions for a solution of problem<a class="headerlink" href="#good-decisions-for-a-solution-of-problem" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Actually,  I prefer to review process and research  more for problem.  This approach tremendously help me in almost of time.
I make important decisions by examining all the details and then weighing the pro's and con's for each decision.
I believe  all decisions should  be made  by having all the information if you are missing an important details it's easy to make a bad decision.  So
I make important decisions by having all of the information.
Important  decisions are made by knowledge through Information and wisdom through experience.I'll gather all the information I can find and then apply my experience while analyzing the information  with this combination I'm confident I'll make the correct important  decisions.</p>
<h1 id="poor-decisions">poor decisions<a class="headerlink" href="#poor-decisions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Yah it is due to making a bad assumption. But I always try to learn about it.</p>
<h1 id="failed-to-complete-an-assignment-on-time">failed to complete an assignment on time<a class="headerlink" href="#failed-to-complete-an-assignment-on-time" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>External factors caused me to missed a deadline.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is meaning of Success and failure to you?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="success">Success<a class="headerlink" href="#success" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>To achieve a goal I have set for myself .
Success to me is knowing that  my contributions positively Impacted on my company and complete assignments on time in a excellent manner.</p>
<h1 id="failure-mean-to-you">Failure mean to you<a class="headerlink" href="#failure-mean-to-you" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>I think failure is not reaching  your potential.
I think to fail at something is making  a mistake and not learning anything form it. So learning  from mistake is a valuable lesson.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Risk
I consider myself to be in the middle .
Before  taking a risk,  I always evaluate all of other options, the pro's and con's success and failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mistake</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning from a mistake is the key point.
Maybe one section misinterpreted by me so in this situation  I always ask more clarification.</p>
<ol>
<li>Aiming</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't miss wonderful opportunity because I aim is too high.
Aiming keeps me focused and forces me to growth  by trying to reach high goals I have set for myself.
Executing a plan has always  come  easy for me as well.
I decided  to put more emphasis on priority and planning.
My short term goal is to find a position where I can use the knowledge and strengths that I have. My long term goal is to become skilled in all aspects of developing to get more experience.I am willing to work hard.
Contributing to a company where I'll become a valuable  asset.</p>
<ol>
<li>change one thing about  your personality</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish I was more patient with people  and I would  like to be more understanding. Because when happened misunderstanding that will makes bad consequences although  I believe to forgive  people as long as possible.
I handle changes smoothly.
I am good at dealing  with change  because I'm flexible with my work.  I analyze the situation and I always try to find ways I can contribute  to the change in positive way.</p>
<ol>
<li>do you work under pressure</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes because I don't panic.  I maintain self-control as work as efficiently as possible. If the situation involved pressure due to lack of time, then the only difference in my work would be the extra time I would need to put in to meet the deadline on time. I use the feelings of pressure as a tool to motivate me to work harder and more efficiency.</p>
<p>=====================</p>
<p>I think  you've answered  a slightly  different  question.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I'd welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role with you.</p>
<p>1471 tell me more about the projects you mentioned on your CV. Can you let me see I guess the purpose is to look at ways of increasing the company's income without adding additional cost. That that's that's very important. But most of our employees would shift so, you know when looking at a different things like how do you shift patent maybe and ways of multitasking set up for each other's absences and sickness. I guess you can let the team building. Can you tell me about your responsibilities and you will jump at the moment sure. I'm the stuff development supervisor. So that means I have some money to stop and identify areas where skills need to be supplemented or improved. It's about designing and implementing training programs. When and where they are needed to make sure we get the most from All-Star and to make sure they're happy to of course. Actually I established a new system to assess performance. That seems to be very effective. free why do you want to work for this company? Because you leave the marketing Communications technology and you have the best reputation of any company in the business. I like the corporate culture. You are an ethical company, but you're so you know, the driven by profit that's important wants to work for the best. I think I might be happy gay. I need to relocate but that's fine. It's not fall. Recording 71 speaker one will last year. I tried to establish a new system for internal mail, but it was a complete disaster. I didn't take enough time to introduce it and nobody knew how it worked. I learned that all those something seems clear to me. It doesn't mean that everyone else understands. I'll take more time and do more trials before I try anything like that again. I think it's too. Well. I enjoy the job I'm doing and I guess I'm well with everyone but I really want to move on and try something new. I've had this job for 2 years now and I think I've outgrown it. I'm ready for a new challenge something that stretches me. Speaker story. I tend to worry too much whether the customer is satisfied or not. And that means sometimes I spend too much time on my customer another lifetime on other aspects of the job. recording 70 to 1 the printer</p>
