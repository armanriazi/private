I can't get my head round this. I'm having difficulty getting to grips with this. This isn't sinking in. [2] It's time to knock off. You've done enough. I think that's enough for now. Let's leave it there. Let's call it a day. Let's wrap it up there. [3] Let's look at the backstory\u2026 The reason we're in this situation in the first place is\u2026 Let me just fill you in with the background\u2026. Let's just remind ourselves how we got here in the first place\u2026 [4] I'm really sorry to let you down. Sorry to disappoint you but\u2026 It's not how we planned it but... [5] It would be great if you could... I'd really appreciate it if you would... Would you mind...? I'd really appreciate it if... [6] We're operating in tough economic conditions. We need to meet our sales targets. Pull your socks up! You shouldn't mix business with pleasure. [7] I'll be advertising for a replacement for Tom today. I want to make some changes in the office. I need to turn this business round. I'm keen to hear your ideas. [8] I have had some head space and a chance to chew things over. I've come to a final decision. I'll give it a go. You won't regret your decision. [9] Don't be too hasty. Don't rush into making a decision. We can work this out. [10] This promotion recognises your achievements at the company. It's an opportunity of a lifetime. You would be my right-hand man/woman. [11] I've been doing a strategic review of the company. I need to downsize. I need you to step aside. The company needs new direction and more dynamic leadership. You are surplus to requirement. [12] Could I check availability for your venue please? What business facilities do you have? How many people can the room or venue hold? Can you provide hospitality? How much does it cost? [13] I've got to prioritise. This task is the most important so I'm going to concentrate on this first. It would be a great help if you could do this for me please. I'm going to have to put that off until tomorrow, I'm afraid. [14] Let me show you the ropes. Watch what I do for a while. Why don't you make a start on this? I'm here to help, so please ask me if you need to know what to do. [15] You're the boss and I think the news is better coming from you. It was your decision in the first place so you need to explain that the situation has changed. This is your responsibility. And here are some phrases your boss might use to apologise: [16] I've been rethinking our staffing situation in the office. Sorry, I made a mistake. I miscalculated my staffing numbers. I would love to have you back in the office. [17] We're a bit busy at the moment; could I take your name and we'll call you back? When would be a convenient time to call you? Could I take a message please and I'll make sure he/she calls you back? [18] You need to think positively. Try looking in the job section in the newspaper. There are loads of job-finding websites you could sign up for. What about ringing some of the people you know? You could register with a recruitment agency. [19] I have a specific idea in mind. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on how to improve my idea. I'd like to use your design skills to produce a fantastic product. I need to sign off your designs before they go into production. [20] We've got to move the furniture around. I'm afraid I've got to let you go. I'm giving you seven days' notice.
